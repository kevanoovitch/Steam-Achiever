# Steam-Achiever
A repository for my steam achievement tracker this is mostly a personal use case that allows me to get familiar with react and some frontend development. 

## Goals of the projects
- To be able to fetch and track steam achievements based on profile
- To filter finished achievements
- To gain some type of persistence
